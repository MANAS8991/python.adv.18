    "Text files are human-readable files that store data as plain text using character encoding schemes such as ASCII or Unicode. They contain sequences of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and control characters, organized in lines of text. Text files can be easily opened and read by humans using text editors or word processors. They are commonly used for storing textual data such as source code, configuration files, or plain text documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, binary files store data in a format that is not directly readable by humans. They store data as sequences of binary digits (0s and 1s) in a structured manner that represents various types of data, including numbers, images, audio, video, or program executables. Binary files are often more compact and efficient in storing data compared to text files. They require specific software or programs to interpret and process the data correctly. Binary files can only be read and understood by applications or programs that are designed to handle their specific file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between text files and binary files lies in how the data is represented and stored. Text files store data as human-readable text, while binary files store data as binary digits in a format specific to the data type being stored."
